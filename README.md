#RSA BigInt generator
This is a convenience helper application for generating prime numbers to use in an RSA encryption function, using the systems default CS-PRNG.

You may provide the target prime numbers bit-length as an argument to the program, but the default is 512bits (which is exactly what the RuneScape Classic client is configured for, out of the box).
